    The even natural numbers.
d. {n| n = 2m for some m in N , and n = 3k for some k in N }

    All positive multiples of 6.
e. {w| w is a string of 0s and 1s and w equals the reverse of w}

    All binary palindromes.
f. {n| n is an integer and n = n + 1}

    The empty set.

### Excercise No. 3
Let A be the set {x, y, z} and B be the set {x, y}.
a. Is A a subset of B?

    No.

b. Is B a subset of A?

    Yes.

c. What is A ∪ B?

    {x, y, z}

d. What is A ∩ B?

    {x, y}

e. What is A × B?

    {(x, x), (x, y), (y, x), (y, y), (z, x), (z, y)}

f. What is the power set of B?
### Excercise No. 4
If A has a elements and B has b elements, how many elements are in A × B? Explain your answer.

    We have a × b elements in A × B. Because we multiply each  element in A with all elements in B.

### Excercise No. 5
